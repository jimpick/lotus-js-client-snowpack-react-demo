# lotus-js-client-snowpack-react-demo

This demo of [js-lotus-client](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client)
connects to an isolated "local net" built with the testnet/3 branch
of the Filecoin Lotus implementation. The local net has 1 genesis node,
plus 2 additional nodes (all running miners). You can "pledge" a sector, and
watch how the nodes + miners handle it.

Try it out!

If you want to run it yourself, clone this repo, run `npm install`, and then `npm start`.
